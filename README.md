## Static and Dynamic Arrays
### Objectives:
In both the static and dynamics arrays files (lab1_staticarrays.cpp &
lab1_dynamicarrays), we demonstrated the usage of both types of arrays. For the
static arrays, we store a fixed number of 10 integers. For the dynamic array, we
have the size be determined by the userâ€™s input (either size is 10, 25, or 50). The
functions that were implemented for both files are: insert, delete, search, and
display.

## Multi-dimensional Arrays
### Objectives:
In the file (lab1_multidimarrays.cpp), we created a program that simulates a basic
spreadsheet utilizing 2D arrays. We implemented functions to: allow users to
input data into specific cells, calculate the sum and average of each row and
column, find the maximum and minimum values in the entire spreadsheet, and a
search function to find a specific value and return its cell position.

## Linked Lists
### Objectives:
In the file (lab1_linkedlists.cpp), we created a program where we implement
functions to operate on a list of characters from the input (in this case, the input is:
I know how to use a linked list now!). We took an input of characters and stored it
as the list and printed text using linked lists. To utilize the three types of linked
lists, we created a structure set for each and one of them: single linked list,
double, and circular linked lists.
